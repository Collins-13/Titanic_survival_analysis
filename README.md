# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival, including the impact of age, gender, and passenger class. It also examines patterns in the data and uses predictive modeling to estimate the likelihood of survival.

## Project Title: Titanic Survival - Understanding Patterns and Predicting Outcomes

## Background

The Titanic disaster of 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This dataset provides information about passengers, including age, gender, class, and whether they survived. Analyzing this data allows us to understand patterns in survival and apply predictive modeling techniques.
  
## Business Task

The goal is to analyze the dataset to identify factors that influenced survival and build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a passenger surviving the disaster.

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas): For loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.

* Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn): For exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations to spot patterns.

* Python (Scikit-learn): For building and evaluating predictive models, such as Logistic Regression.

## Data Source

The data was taken from the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). It includes information on passengers such as age, gender, passenger class, ticket details, and survival status, providing a historical record to analyze factors that influenced survival.


## Summarized Findings

### Plots Summary
- Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates compared to 2nd and 3rd class.  
- Women were more likely to survive than men.  
- Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival probabilities.  
- Age distribution shows most passengers were 20-40 years old, with survival varying across age groups.

### Modeling & Evaluation Summary
- Logistic Regression was used to predict survival.  
- The model achieved reasonable accuracy and helped quantify survival probabilities.  
- Insights from exploratory analysis were validated through model predictions, confirming the influence of class, gender, and age on survival.

## Outputs

All analysis, modelling and evaluations are included in the project folders in this repository.

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Learning Journey** through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science Lab at WorldQuant University, and served as my task for the **Owl AI Virtual Internship - September 2025**. 

It demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling using real-world datasets.
